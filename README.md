# Fundementals-Of-Computting-II-Projects
Auburn Java II Projects/Assignments.
The class contained 5 different main projects
1. WordSearch
  - The program is designed so that a board of letters can be passed in and then 
  set of possible words are found according to the rules of the word search game.
2. Doublets
  - In this program you are given a word. You must then determine the number of changes letter 
  by letter in the word to reach a end destination word. Each change in letter must result in 
  a valid word.
3. LinkedSet
  - This project was given to learn more about Linked List. We designed the basic functions of a Linked List 
  using the doubly-linked list data structure.
4. Selector
  - This was a early on project used to introduce generics and enhance our familarity with Java. we designed 
  functions such as min/max functions as well as kth min/max functions.
5. SortingLab
  - This program allowed us to take in a set of functions that each used different search types (Merge Sort, Selection 
  Sort, Quick Sort, etc). We would then run time test on the functions to figure out which unknown sort function was which.
